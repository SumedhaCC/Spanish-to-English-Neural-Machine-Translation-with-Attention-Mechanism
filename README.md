# Spanish-to-English-Neural-Machine-Translation-with-Attention-Mechanism
This project aims to build a sequence-to-sequence model with attention mechanism for translating Spanish sentences to fluent English. This model will empower communication between Spanish-speaking communities and English-speaking businesses.
Why is this Important?

Enables seamless communication for Spanish speakers interacting with English speakers.
Assists local businesses in dealing with international clients.
Provides foundational knowledge of attention-based sequence-to-sequence models.
Challenges:

Handling special characters in Spanish text.
Project Approach:

Data Preprocessing:

Acquire Spanish-English parallel corpus.
Clean data by addressing:
Special characters in Spanish text (e.g., accents, punctuation)
Inconsistent formatting (e.g., extra spaces, capitalization)
Model Building:

Implement a sequence-to-sequence model with:
Encoder-decoder architecture
Attention mechanism for context awareness
Utilize libraries like TensorFlow or Keras for efficient implementation.
Training and Evaluation:

Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.
Monitor training progress with metrics like BLEU score (measures translation quality).
Translation:

Translate new Spanish sentences into English using the trained model.
Evaluate translation quality for fluency and accuracy.
